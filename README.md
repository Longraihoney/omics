The below list is merely from my scientific experience and perspective. Hope it helps!

# Useful omics tools:

## PiGx: Pipelines in Genomics
## Network-Based Integrative Analysis (for metabolomics data combined with related transcriptomics information) with MetaBridge
## TCGAbiolinks: An R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis with GDC data
## MetProc: Separating Measurement Artifacts from True Metabolites in an Untargeted Metabolomics Experiment
## Small Molecule Pathway Database
## The harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins
## FELLA: an R package to enrich metabolomics data 
## LIPEA: a package for Lipid Pathway Enrichment Analysis 
## CEU Mass Mediator: a tool for searching metabolites in different databases (Kegg, HMDB, LipidMaps, Metlin, MINE and an in-house library) 
## MS-DIAL: data-independent MS/MS deconvolution for comprehensive metabolome analysis
## Qiita: rapid, web-enabled microbiome meta-analysis
## REVIGO and WEGO for GO annotation and visualization.
## BioJupies: Automated Generation of Interactive Notebooks for RNA-Seq Data Analysis in the Cloud
## LipidPedia - An encyclopedia of lipids providing associated biomedical information 
## MitoMiner 4.0 - A database of mammalian mitochondrial localisation evidence, phenotypes and diseases
## LipiDex: An Integrated Software Package for High-Confidence Lipid Identification
## MetaboList: Annotation of Metabolites from Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Data

# Good data handling and analysis packages

## car: Companion to Applied Regression: I sometimes use this package to reassign the name of the columns in the data set
## forcats for handling categorical variables, especially for visualization [link]. E.g., fct_rev(fct_infreq(x)) for "ordered from top to bottom, highest count to lowest".

# Visualization tools:

## BPG: Seamless, automated and interactive visualization of scientific data
## Biorender - professional visualization for life sciences. Note: not free for publication!
## From data to viz (with code)
## DIVE: Turn your data into stories without writing code

# Good books:

## Interpretable Machine Learning
## Seeing theory - to study probability and statistics
## Fundamentals of Data Visualization
## Mathematics for Machine Learning - only for beginners or practical users.  
## Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models
## Metabolic profiling series from Springer. 

# Good papers:

## Structure annotation of all mass spectra in untargeted metabolomics 
## Peak annotation and verification engine (PAVE) for untargeted LC-MS metabolomics 
## From RNA-seq reads to differential expression results 
## Evaluation and comparison of bioinformatic tools for the enrichment analysis of metabolomics data 
## From mass to metabolite in human untargeted metabolomics: recent advances in annotation of metabolites applying liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data 
## Bad practices in evaluation methodology relevant to class-imbalanced problems

# Good courses:

## Khan academy
## DataCamp 
## MIT Computational biology 

# Others:

## RNAseq analysis in R 
## Common transition words and phrases 
## Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data
